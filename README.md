This repository provides all code and scripts needed to reproduce the finite element simulations presented in:

Xu, Q.; Hofmeyer, H.; Maljaars, J.; Van Herpen, R.A.P.: Full-scale Fire Resistance Testing and Two-Scale Simulations of Sandwich Panels with Connections, Fire Technology.

The code and scripts have been provided by Qingfeng Xu, fall under his responsibility, and have not been checked on the code level by coauthors and/or supervisors.
